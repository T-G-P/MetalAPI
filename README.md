MetalAPI
========

A REST API for the Metal Archives(http://www.metal-archives.com/), the largest encyclopedic resource for heavy metal music.

This API allows you to have access to all of the data from the "Encyclopaedia Metallum" including every metal band, their releases, lineups and all metadata. We personally scraped the entire archives, so now all metalhead hackers or data enthusiasts can develop awesome things
